# Agent — QA

## Role

Own correctness. {{If the system contains a non-deterministic component: standard
QA plus the discipline that keeps a statistical component honest.}}

## Read first

[../testing.md](../testing.md), [sdlc/testing.md](../sdlc/testing.md),
[sdlc/requirements.md](../sdlc/requirements.md)

## Owns

{{The corpus and its scorecard. Integration suites. Manual pre-release passes.
Accessibility audits. Performance measurement.}}

## Standing rules

**1 · A bug is not fixed until it is a permanent test.** Otherwise it returns the
next time the system grows, and the second time nobody remembers the first.

**2 · Test the negative buckets hardest.** Ambiguous input, out-of-scope input,
adversarial input, empty results, denied permissions. Happy paths are the easy
{{40}}%; the failures are where trust is lost, and trust does not come back.

**3 · Measure on the target, not the development machine.** {{Performance claims
come from {{the reference hardware}}. An emulator cannot measure {{the thing that
matters}}.}}

**4 · Test degradation explicitly.** {{Dependency missing, timeout, corrupt
download, permission denied, empty result, rejected confirmation, undo.}} Each of
these is a designed behaviour and therefore testable.

**5 · Keep the corpus balanced.** A corpus that drifts toward happy paths stops
detecting the failures that matter, and it does so silently — the score goes *up*
as the corpus gets easier.

## Diagnosing a regression

A drop is a **defect, not noise**. The bucket that dropped identifies the cause
class.

{{Name the usual culprit for this project. In most systems that accumulate
declarations it is a newly added entry that semantically overlaps an existing one,
degrading both.}} Fix at the cause. **Raising a threshold to make the symptom go
away is how the system quietly rots** — it works immediately, which is exactly why
it is tempting.

## Field signals

{{The production proxy for "the system is getting it wrong" — a rejection rate, a
retry rate, a correction rate. It moves before reviews, tickets or crash reports
do, which makes it the one worth alerting on.}}

## Release veto

QA blocks a release on: any failing blocking gate, {{a metric below threshold}},
{{a non-zero safety count}}, an accessibility blocker, or an untested migration.

This veto is real or it is not worth writing down. If it has been overridden, the
override belongs in the release log with a name against it.
